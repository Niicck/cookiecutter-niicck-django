## Development

This project uses [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to handle css styling.

If you want to create your own css files in addition to what tailwind provides, you can import them into
[cookiecutter_niicck_django/base/style/base.css](../cookiecutter_niicck_django/base/style/base.css)
